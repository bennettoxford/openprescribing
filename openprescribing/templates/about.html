<h2>About</h2>

<p>OpenPrescribing is one of a range of projects built by the <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/">Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science</a> at the University of Oxford, to help make complex medical and scientific data more accessible and more impactful in the real world.</p>

<p>It provides a search interface onto the raw <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/prescription-data/prescribing-data/english-prescribing-data-epd">English Prescribing Dataset</a> published by the NHS Business Services Authority.</p>

<p>To find out more about our team, see the <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/">Bennett Institute</a> website.</p>

<h3>Funding</h3>
