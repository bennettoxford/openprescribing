<h3 id="siteupdate">When do you update the site?</h3>
<p>We use the <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/prescription-data/prescribing-data/english-prescribing-data-epd">English prescribing dataset</a> from the NHS Business Services Authority (BSA). The BSA have a release calendar for this dataset, although the data is sometimes released early. We aim to update OpenPrescribing by the Wednesday following the release date, but do try to update earlier if the BSA publish sooner. The data is two months behind, so for example January's prescribing data is published in March. </p>
<p> You can find out when OpenPrescribing has been updated by following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenPrescribing">Twitter</a> or signing up to one of our <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2017/02/openprescribing-e-mail-alerts/">e-mail alerts</a>.</p>

<h3 id="extractdownload">How do I download an extract of the data?</h3>
<p>We have written a <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2017/06/downloading-data-from-openprescribing/">blog post</a> on how to download data from the Trends and Analyse sections of the site. It is now also possible to download data extracts from our dashboard pages.</p>

<h3 id="cite">How do I cite OpenPrescribing?</h3>
<p>You are welcome to use data or graphs from this site in your academic output with attribution. Please cite <em>OpenPrescribing.net, Bennett Institute for Applied Data Science, University of Oxford, {% current_time "%Y" %}</em> as the source for academic attribution.</p>

<p>If you use data or images from this site online or in a report, please link back to us. Your readers will then be able to see live updates to the data you are interested in, and explore other queries for themselves.</p>

<h3 id="timeperiod">What time period does the dataset cover?</h3>
<p>We have data from the past 5 years on OpenPrescribing.net.</p>

<h3 id="olddata">How can I access data older than available on your website?</h3>
<p>Given our limited resources, we do not routinely provide data not accessible through the website. However, you may be able to access this data yourself. The NHS BSA openly publishes the <a href="https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/english-prescribing-data-epd">English prescribing dataset</a> dating back to January 2014. If data prior to 2014 is required, the <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections/prescription-cost-analysis-england">Prescription Cost Analysis dataset</a> is accessible from 1998 onward although is not as detailed as the English Prescribing Dataset.</p>

<h3 id="compare">Why do OpenPrescribing figures not always match with other prescribing data analysis platforms?</h3>
<p>At OpenPrescribing we anticipate that our results will not always be exactly the same as those displayed on alternative data analysis platforms. There are two common reasons for this. Firstly, different platforms may use different underlying datasets. At OpenPrescribing we use two openly available datasets: the <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/prescription-data/prescribing-data/english-prescribing-data-epd">English Prescribing dataset (EPD)</a> and the <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/prescription-data/dispensing-data/prescription-cost-analysis-pca-data"> Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA)</a>. Secondly, different platforms will make different choices in their analytic code for preparing the data and displaying it to users.</p>
<p>All our code used in data preparation, analysis and visualisation is openly available on the Bennett Institute <a href="https://github.com/ebmdatalab/openprescribing"> Github</a> for inspection and re-use by anyone. You can also click on the "<i>view technical details for this measure</i>" link in each measure to show exactly what code we are using to create it.</p>

<h3 id="subscribe">How do I subscribe/unsubscribe from emails?</h3>
<p>You can subscribe to our monthly prescribing update emails by going to the dashboard for your chosen organisation (for example by using the "Area and Practice Dashboards" option from our navigation bar), then entering your email address under the "Sign up for alerts or updates" section:</p>

<h2>Prescribing Dataset</h2>

<h3 id="datasource">Where do you get the data from?</h3>
<p>See our <a href="/about">About</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="patientinfo">Is there any patient age or disease information in the dataset?</h3>
<p>No, the prescribing dataset we use does not contain any patient information.</p>

<h3 id="prescitem">What is a prescription item?</h3>

<p>
  <em>Items</em> counts the number of times a medicine has been prescribed. It
  says nothing about how much of it has been prescribed (for that see <a
    href="#prescquantity">quantity</a>) as some presciptions will be for many
  weeks’ worth of treatment while others will be much smaller.
</p>
<p>
  For more detail see the NHS Digital Practice level prescribing 
  <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/areas-of-interest/prescribing/practice-level-prescribing-in-england-a-summary/practice-level-prescribing-glossary-of-terms#items">glossary of terms</a>
</p>

<h3 id="prescquantity">What does quantity mean?</h3>
<p>
  <em>Quantity</em> is the total amount of a medicine that has been prescribed,
  but the units used depend on the particular form the medicine
  is in:
</p>
<p>
  • Where the formulation is tablet, capsule, ampoule, vial etc the quantity
  will be the number of tablets, capsules, ampoules, vials etc
</p>
<p>
  • Where the formulation is a liquid the quantity will be the number of
  millilitres
</p>
<p>
  • Where the formulation is a solid form (eg. cream, gel, ointment) the
  quantity will be the number of grams
</p>
<p>
  • Where the formulation is inhalers the quantity is usually the number of
  inhalers (but there are occasionally inconsistencies here so exercise caution
  when analysing this data)
</p>
<p>
  Care must be taken when adding together quantities. Obviously quantities
  cannot be added across units. But even within a given unit it may not make
  sense to add together quantities of different preparations with different
  strengths and formulations.
</p>
<p>
  For more detail see the NHS Digital Practice level prescribing

</p>

<h3 id="actualcost">What is actual cost?</h3>
<p>
  <em>Actual cost</em> is the estimated cost to the NHS of supplying a
  medicine. The Drug Tariff and other price lists specify a Net Ingredient Cost
  (NIC) for a drug, but pharmacists usually receive a discount on this price.
  Additionally they receive a "container allowance" each time they dispense a
  prescription. The <em>actual cost</em> is estimated from the <em>net
  ingredient cost</em> by subtracting the average percentage discount
  received by pharmacists in the previous month and adding in the cost of the
  container allowance.
</p>

</p>

<h3 id="bnfchange">How do you deal with BNF code changes?</h3>
<p>Chemicals can occasionally be re-classified from one BNF code to another. An example of this is Linaclotide, which changed from 0102000AH to <a href="/chemical/0106070B0">0106070B0</a> in 2013.</p>
<p>We have aimed to normalise the data so that past prescribing is always listed under the current BNF code. This means if you look at Linaclotide’s trends page, you will see the prescribing pre-2013 even though the code changed.</p>
<p>We have done this by mapping the old codes to the new codes, by using a map the NHS Business Services Authority provided us in a personal communication (after correcting for obvious typos etc.). You can read how we did this on <a href="https://github.com/ebmdatalab/openprescribing/pull/380/commits/7f968027263c62318403584e4ad5e0b96869bb7e">github</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more about BNF codes and how they are structured <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2017/04/prescribing-data-bnf-codes/">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ccgchange">How do you determine ICB membership when GP practices have moved ICB or ICB have merged?</h3>
<p>We use the current Integrated Care Board (ICB) membership of a practice in our analyses. If a GP Practice moved ICB, the data from before the move will be included in the data for their current ICB. Their former ICB will not include that practice's data. This means that when you look at our prescribing measures, you will be looking at the past prescribing of the current GP practices in that ICB.</p>
<p>When ICBs merge, we create a new dashboard for the newly formed ICB and remove the old ICB dashboards. We use the prescribing data for the current practices in the new ICB in our measures. Any data for practices in the old ICBs that closed prior to the merger will be included in the new ICB's data</p>
<p>Data from our analyse and trends pages also use current practice membership of a ICB when aggregating the data by ICB</p>

<h3 id="fp34">Do items claimed on FP34 forms show on OpenPrescribing?</h3>
<p>Medicines claimed under an "FP34" form by GP practices fall into two categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>High Volume Vaccines (influenza, typhoid, hepatitis A, hepatitis B , pneumococcal, meningococcal vaccines). </b>These vaccines are purchased by the practices, and are claimed for on <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/prescribing-and-dispensing/high-volume-vaccine-forms-fp34dpd-appendix-forms"> FP34D (for dispensing practices) and FP34PD (for other practices) appendices</a>.  No FP10 is required to claim these items.</li>
  <li><b>Other items (for example injections and local anaesthetics. </b>These items are often "personally adminstered" by GP practices, and although the payment for the <i>administration</i> is claimed for via the FP34 form by the practice, a separate FP10 for item will need to be submitted as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Medicines administered to patients under both categories appear in OpenPrescribing data.  For example <a href="https://openprescribing.net/chemical/1404000H0/"> here is data on influenza vaccines</a>, which are usually claimed on FP34D/PD.</p>

<h3 id="ssps">How do items dispensed under a Serious Shortage Protocol (SSP) appear in OpenPrescribing?</h3>
<p>The BSA <a href="https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/65050ec0-5abd-48ce-989d-defc08ed837e/discussions/2">have confirmed</a> that the prescribing dataset we use shows entries for items dispensed under an SSP, but does not include information on the item originally prescribed.</p>

<h3 id="concessioncosts">How are price concession costs calculated?</h3>
<p>
  The extra costs for an organisation implied by a price concession are
  calculated as the difference between the drug tariff price and the concession
  price <em>after</em> applying the relevant discounts, multiplied by the
  quantity prescribed by that organisation.
</p>
<p>
  For concessions prior to April 2023 we appply the national average discount
  of 7.2% to both the tariff price and the concession price. From April 2023
  onwards we no longer apply any discount to the concession price, as <a
    href="https://cpe.org.uk/our-news/changes-to-discount-deduction-arrangements-from-april-2023/">specified
    by CPE</a>. From April 2024, we apply a different discount rate to tariff
  prices depending on the <a
    href="https://www.drugtariff.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/#/00857004-DC/DC00856269/Part%20V%20-%20Deduction%20Scale%20(Pharmacy%20Contractors)">category
    of the product</a>: 20% for generics, 9.85% discount for appliances and 5%
  discount for everything else.

<h2>Analyse</h2>
<h3 id="analysetutorial">How do I use the analyse page?</h3>
<p>Instructions are found <a href="/docs/analyse">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="denominator">What denominator should I use?</h3>
<p>We use this site a lot for our own work and our own research. When we use the <a href="{% url 'analyse' %}">analysis page</a>, we find it useful to choose denominators cautiously.</p>

<p>You can use "list size" which tells you how many patients a practice covers, but this can be problematic, because different practices will have different kinds of patients, some with lots of older people, and so on.</p>

<p>When using the data ourselves we tend to use more thoughtful approaches to try to "bake in" population prevalence or need for a particular condition, or to explore different prescribing patterns. For example, we often use whole classes of drug as the denominator in our analyses, as in the video walkthroughs; or we compare the use of one drug against the use of another. When looking at whether a practice is using a lot of Nexium (an expensive "proton pump inhibitor" pill for treating ulcers) we might look at "Nexium prescribing" versus "all proton pump inhibitor prescribing" (<a href="{% url 'analyse' %}#org=Sub-ICB Location&numIds=0103050E0BB&denomIds=1.3.5">example</a>).</p>

<p>We have removed STAR-PUs as a denominator option on our analysis page and from several of our pre-built antibiotic measures. This decision was made following user consultation, due to concerns about the appropriateness of the STAR-PU weightings, which have not been reviewed since 2013. You can read more about this in our <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2024/02/star-pus-should-we-still-be-using-them/">blog</a>.</p>

<h2>Dashboards</h2>

<h3 id="measureinterpret">How should I interpret the measures?</h3>
<p>We recommend reading NHS Digitals's <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/areas-of-interest/prescribing/practice-level-prescribing-in-england-a-summary">Practice Level Prescribing in England: a summary</a>, including the <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/areas-of-interest/prescribing/practice-level-prescribing-in-england-a-summary/practice-level-prescribing-data-more-information">more information section</a> and <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/areas-of-interest/prescribing/practice-level-prescribing-in-england-a-summary/practice-level-prescribing-glossary-of-terms">glossary of terms</a>.</p>

<p>Just because a practice or NHS organisation is an outlier for high or low use of a particular treatment, that doesn't necessarily mean they are good or bad prescribers. These are <em>measures</em> rather than <em>indicators</em>, and they need to be interpreted judiciously.</p>

<p>For example, a practice that prescribes a lot of benzodiazepines may have a lower threshold for prescribing them, or may run a specialist service for people with substance misuse, or have one doctor with an interest in - and long list of - such patients.</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert" style="max-width: 800pxt">
<strong>Warning!</strong> These are important measures, but they should be interpreted thoughtfully. There may be good reasons why a practice is prescribing more or less of something than other practices in the country, e.g. they may have a very different patient population to the national average.
</div>

<h3 id="measurechose">How are the measures chosen?</h3>
<p>Our original measures were developed in discussion between Drs Jeff Aronson, Kamal Mahtani, <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/about-us/ben-goldacre/">Ben Goldacre</a> at the University of Oxford, and <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/about-us/richard-croker/">Richard Croker</a> from NHS Devon.  The Bennett Institute team now create measures based on ideas for research, national guidelines, and from our users.  Please do <a href="mailto:{{ FEEDBACK_MAILTO }}">get in touch</a> if you have an idea for a possible new measure.</p>

<h3 id="measurechose">How do you work out savings on individual presentations?</h3>

<p>
  There can be huge variation in the price a practice or NHS organisation pay for a treatment, even for the same drug at the same dose. It is well known that branded and generic versions of the same treatment will have different prices; but different specific “brands” of “branded generic” may also have different prices; and there are many other similar sources of variation in price. Every month we estimate what could be saved if every organisation were prescribing as well as the best 10%, for each item prescribed. <a href="/price-per-unit-faq/">Read our detailed FAQ on the subject here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ghostgenerics">How do you calculate savings for ghost-branded generics?</h3>
<p>Ghost-branded generics are generic items which have unintentionally been prescribed with a manufacturer name. For example, Naratriptan 2.5mg Tablets is the correct generic name; a ghost-branded version is Naratriptan 2.5mg Tablets (Teva UK Limited). When an item is prescribed generically, the dispenser is reimbursed at the price in the Drug Tariff; but when a manufacturer is stated, the reimbursement price is usually more expensive.</p>

<p>In some cases, generics will be deliberately prescribed with the manufacturer name, for example where a patient needs to have the same colour pill consistently, or in items with a narrow therapeutic index. However, we assume these are a tiny majority of the total ghost-branded prescribing that happens.</p>

<p>The prescribing data released by NHS BSA aggregates all generic and ghost-generic prescribing together, so it is not possible for us to break down the data precisely.</p>

<p>In addition, the published Drug Tariff prices are not necessarily the ones used by BSA for reimbursement (see <a href="https://github.com/bennettoxford/openprescribing/issues/1318">our technical notes here</a> for an explanation of this). Therefore, to estimate the size of the problem for individual practices or NHS organisations, we first have to estimate the Drug Tariff price for a generic, which we do by taking the median price paid for that generic item across the entire country. This gives us a price that <em>should</em> be paid for all prescriptions of that generic. We then compare this with the price that was used for reimbursement. This difference gives a reasonable estimate of the total possible savings if a generic were prescribed correctly. We only include savings of more than £5. Note that we use Net Ingredient Cost for our calculations; the true reimbursement cost will typically be 7% less due to bulk discounts.</p>

<p>You can read more about the background of this issue <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2018/12/ghost-branded-generics-why-does-the-cost-of-generic-atorvastatin-vary/">on our blog</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ghostgenericshow">How can I decrease our use of ghost-branded generics?</h3>
<p>The spreadsheet download on ghost-branded generics page is sorted by total possible savings.  The practices and items appearing near the top of this list are likely to be prescribing the highest level of ghost-branded generics.  ePACT2 now carries data at an <em>AMPP</em> level for ghost-generics (termed "premium price generics"), meaning you can identify individual scripts which are at fault; PrescQIPP has also added ghost-generic reports and searches.</p>
<p>In general, the fix will be dependent on your prescribing software. It should be possible to configure it so only true generics can be picked, at least for the most egregious items.</p>
<p>We are currently gathering feedback from practices who have implemented such fixes, and will publish a summary on our blog in due course.</p>

<h3 id="gpclose">A GP Practice has closed or merged - why is it included on your dashboards?</h3>
<p>
  OpenPrescribing uses the prescribing dataset published monthly by NHS Digital, which includes the past prescribing for practices that have merged or closed. Data will still show for a closed practice if a prescription prescribed by that surgery was dispensed in the community after the closure date. The historical data for closed practices will continue to be shown on OpenPrescribing, and any practice with a current status of  <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2017/08/what-is-a-dormant-gp-practice-and-why-are-they-prescribing/">Dormant</a> or Closed will be labelled as such. They will continue to be shown under the ICB they were last recorded under.
</p>

<h3 id="wheretrends">What's happened to the Long Term Trends tool?</h3>
<p>We released the long term trends tool in 2017.  The data has not been updated in the tool since the 2018 data release, and unfortunately continued support for the tool is not a priority for us at this time.  The tool is still available <a href="https://openprescribing.net/long_term_trends/">here>/a>, but please be aware we are no longer supporting or updating the data.</p>
