      With the support of the NHS Primary Care and Medicines Analytics Unit we
      have started to build OpenPrescribing Hospitals.

  <p>
    Every month, NHS England publishes processed pharmacy stock control data in
    the form of the
    <a href="https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/dataset/secondary-care-medicines-data-indicative-price">
      Secondary Care Medicines Dataset (SCMD)</a>.

      full technical specification
    </a>
    of the SCMD is available to read, but briefly: it is hospital pharmacy
    stock control data, which is collected and processed by <a href='https://www.rx-info.co.uk' target="_blank"> Rx-info</a>, and is now
    published on the NHS Business Services Authority website in the
    <a href="https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2019/08/what-is-the-dm-d-the-nhs-dictionary-of-medicines-and-devices/">
      NHS dm+d standard</a>.
    We have been spending time learning more about the data and carefully
    curating the data ready for use in OpenPrescribing Hospitals.

    We are working hard to include similar features to OpenPrescribing.net including
    <ul>
      <li>A custom ‘analyse page’</li>
      <li>Pre-built curated measures based on NHS England Medicines Optimisation Opportunities / medicines safety topics which we will expand over time</li>
      <li>A summary of data submitted by NHS Trusts in England</li>
    </ul>
    We will share an early version of this tool in the near future and look forward to hearing your feedback.
