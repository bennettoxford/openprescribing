    "Oral liquid morphine has been implicated in a number of <a href='https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/feature/investigation-should-liquid-morphine-be-reclassified' target='_Blank'>drug-related deaths in the NHS</a>, including cases of unintentional overdose. ",
    "A national <a href='https://www.hssib.org.uk/patient-safety-investigations/unintentional-overdose-of-morphine-sulfate-oral-solution/investigation-report/' target='_Blank'>patient safety investigation</a> has highlighted risks associated with morphine oral solution, including dosing errors and accidental overconsumption.</p>",
    "<p>Particular concerns include the risk of patients 'swigging' morphine oral solution directly from the bottle rather than measuring individual doses, and the supply of large quantities over extended periods. ",
    "The classification of oral morphine solution 10 mg in 5 mL as a Schedule 5 Controlled Drug, rather than a Schedule 2 like other morphine formulations, means it is subject to fewer controls. ",
    "This may increase the likelihood of larger volumes being supplied and continued without the safeguards applied to other opioid formulations.</p>",
    "<p>In addition, morphine oral solution contains high quantities of alcohol and sugar as excipients. ",
    "For example, branded <a href='https://mhraproducts4853.blob.core.windows.net/docs/ded38835b171a612e33c82e0103d5482cd76d1a3' target='_Blank'>Oramorph</a> contains around 90 g of sugar and 24 g of ethanol, equivalent to three units of alcohol, in each 300 mL bottle. ",
    "These factors should be considered alongside the opioid content when assessing clinical risk.</p>",
    "<p>You can read more about the rationale behind this measure, and the wider considerations surrounding the use of oral liquid morphine, ",
