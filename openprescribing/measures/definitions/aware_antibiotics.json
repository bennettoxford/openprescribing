  "<p>The <a href='https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aware-antibiotic-classification/uk-access-watch-reserve-and-other-classification-for-antibiotics-uk-aware-antibiotic-classification'>UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA)</a> has adapted the <a href='https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MHP-HPS-EML-2023.04'>World Health Organizationâ€™s (WHO) AWaRe classification</a> to develop the <a href='https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-aware-antibiotic-classification/uk-access-watch-reserve-and-other-classification-for-antibiotics-uk-aware-antibiotic-classification'>UK-AWaRe antibiotic classification</a>, taking into account antibiotic resistance profiles, antibiotic prescribing and stewardship practice in the UK. The classification groups antibiotics into four categories: Access, Watch, Reserve and Other, to support appropriate prescribing and promote effective antimicrobial stewardship.</p>",
  "<ul>",
  "<li><b>Access antibiotics</b> are generally narrow-spectrum and associated with a lower risk of resistance. They are recommended as first or second choice options for common infections and should be readily available.</li>",
  "<li><b>Watch antibiotics</b> are broader-spectrum with a higher resistance potential. Their use should be limited to specific indications and monitored closely.</li>",
  "<li><b>Reserve antibiotics</b> are last-line treatments, often reserved for severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. These medicines require strict oversight to maintain their effectiveness.</li>",
  "</ul>",
  "<p>Monitoring the use of Watch and Reserve antibiotics can help identify areas to improve prescribing, encouraging the appropriate use of Access antibiotics where clinically suitable, and ensuring that higher-risk antibiotics are used only when necessary.</p>"
