    "Oral liquid morphine has been implicated in drug-related deaths in the NHS. ",
    "It contains high quantities of alcohol and sugar as excipients. ",
    "Patients are often discharged from the acute Trusts with oral liquid morphine because as a Schedule 5 drug it negates the paperwork required for higher schedule Controlled Drugs. ",
    "GPs then continue to prescribe it for some patients."
