    "Oral liquid morphine has been implicated in a number of <a href='https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/feature/investigation-should-liquid-morphine-be-reclassified' target='_Blank'>drug-related ",
    "deaths in the NHS</a>. There have been some concerns regarding accidental overdose, due to the ability to 'swig' the bottle, compared to using solid or orodispersible formulations.</p>" ,
    "<p>Despite these risks, oral liquid morphine is classified as a Schedule 5 Controlled Drug, meaning it is subject to fewer regulatory controls than Schedule 2 morphine tablets. ",
    "This classification reduces prescribing, storage and record keeping requirements, potentially leading it to be perceived as a simple option to give as a just in case of pain at discharge.</p>",
    "<p>Morphine oral solution also contains high quantities of alcohol and sugar as excipients. For example, ",
